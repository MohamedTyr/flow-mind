Response: "I completely understand - nobody likes feeling overwhelmed by calls. That's exactly why I want to make this conversation valuable for you. What's the biggest challenge you're facing with lead management right now?"
</example_statement>

<example_inappropriate>
Input: "This is harassment, I'm reporting this"
Context: Hostile engagement
Response: "I respect your concerns and I'm not here to pressure you. If you'd prefer, I can simply share one quick insight about lead qualification that might be helpful, and then you can decide if it's worth continuing."
